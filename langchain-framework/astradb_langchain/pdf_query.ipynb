It will keep your mind open and thinking. Secondly, you can\\nbecome instantly creative and resourceful when it comes to growing your\\nincome. You can make your mind, body and relationships work harder to\\nachieve this goal. You will also have the ability to come up with big-leap ideas\\nthat can quickly change your income level altogether. A big negative in this\\narea can be your greed. You can sometimes make really silly mistakes, as the\\nmere promise of large or quick returns can �aw your judgement. Another\\nchallenge you may face is that you can fail to consistently grow your own\\nlearning. You are more likely to depend on external factors than to grow your\\nown knowledge and ability to increase your income.\\n2-30 3 69Currently your creativity seems to be heightened to create things that appeal\\nto other people\\'s senses. Objects that are visually appealing, nice to listen to,\\nsmell, taste or touch.3-30 3 69Your current habits indicate that you bring great intensity to your goal,\\nhowever you seem to apply too much force to what you need to achieve. This\\nindicates a low level of patience. This force may have often yielded results\\nand so you seem to rely on it. The problem with this force is that it’s e�ective\\nonly in situations that work out quickly, or where the other person is willing\\nto deal with this force. In many other instances you will �nd this approach\\ncounterproductive. This could make you totally abandon your goal or path,\\nand turn in a new direction and lead to a burn-out. In order to avoid this, you\\nneed to increase your patience and moderate your force. So the golden\\nlearning for you is that \"great intensity can exist without great force\".4-30 3 69Your lack of consistency seems to be the cause of your income-related\\nproblems.\\n5-30 3 69Your habits indicate that your relationship and organisational abilities are an\\narea of concern. They can pull you down �nancially.66-30 3 69Your choices indicate that your inventive and path-breaking thinking is still\\nunderdeveloped and requires some more work.\\nExpenditure Trigger\\n1-30 3 69Your expenditure will rise along with your income. In fact sometimes it may\\nrise faster. This is a real concern area for you and you need to be very\\ncareful. Some of the reasons your expenditure may rise include a need to\\ngrow and create more wealth, that will make you constantly invest in the\\nfuture. Also, you are prone to making risky investments which may be never\\nyield anything. You also tend to be over optimistic and don’t keep an eye on\\nthe bottom line, You believe that somehow you will make so much money,\\nthat it will justify the expenditure.2-30 3 6\\nYour habits indicate that your need for physical comfort is moderate and not\\na big concern area for either your income or expenditure.\\n3-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you are quite fond of enjoyment and/or luxuries.\\nThis tendency can come in the way of your income-expenditure balance.\\n4-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you do not concern yourself enough with your\\npopularity and reputation to make consistent e�orts that could incur\\nexpenses.5-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you have a heightened need for adulation. This\\nemotional need can threaten your income and expenditure balance. It can\\nplace you in poor company as well as prevent you from taking �rm decisions.6-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you should not make investments by yourself. You\\nmust consult a �nancial expert and even then you should not invest in\\nvolatile opportunities.\\nSaving Solution\\n1-30 3 69Always remember that all that glitters is not gold. You have a tendency to be\\ntaken in by other people\\'s success or deceptive get-rich-quick schemes that\\nlook good from the outside. You are prone to wager your savings on what\\nlooks like gold without thinking it through. You are prone to sudden\\nexcitement and when something catches your fancy your emotions take\\nover. You have to learn to slow down and think things through, otherwise\\nyou may waste your earnings or disposable wealth.22-30 3 69Making your money make money for you is not an act of heroism. Taking\\ncredit and feeling heroic are not emotions that belong with this act. You\\nseem to be too interested in victory and dominance and these are not the\\nlanguage of money making money. In fact money making money can be\\nboring and slow. So please develop a taste for boring and slow.\\nFunctional Wealth\\n1-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you need a pillar of strength in your life to maintain\\nfunctional wealth. In other words, without someone\\'s help you will not be\\nable to put together enough savings to live well without an income for 10\\nyears.\\nOther Important Factors11-30 3 69Your habits indicate that �nancial discipline is your area of concern. You\\nmust improve on this or all your hard work may come to nothing in the end.\\nAlso, you should choose someone to handle your �nances and listen to\\nthem. Your own mind can make you lose all you have and earn. So either\\nwork on this area or let someone else deal with your �nancial decision-\\nmaking.\\n2-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you are going through an alarming phase or you\\nhave some alarming tendencies with regard to taking risks. Please be very\\ncareful while assessing risks. You can take disproportionate risks and this can\\nhave long-term consequences. Please listen to critics and extremely mature\\npeople.3-30 3 69Currently your habits indicate that your wealth will keep �uctuating. You are\\nlikely to see many ups and downs in your life.

Your friends and family understand that\\nyou have other priorities. Sometimes this may become an issue in your life\\nand you have to learn to deal with this.2-30 3 69Your habits indicate that although you are a dependable person, sometimes\\nother priorities may take precedence. Thus on occasion close friends and\\nfamily may consider you unpredictable.\\n3-30 3 69Your habits indicate that your family and close friends �nd you consistent\\nmost of the time, but cannot be 100% sure about you.\\n4-30 3 69Your habits indicate that your loyalty, dependability and consistency is not\\nattached to an organisation or group unless that organisation or group is\\nfully in your control.How An Organisation Sees You\\n1-30 3 69Your habits indicate that irrespective of your intentions, your organisation or\\ngroup will not value you for your loyalty, dependability or consistency.\\nHowever, they might �nd you consistent with your creative skills, your ability\\nto solve certain problems or to perform speci�c tasks that others may not be\\nable to do.\\nHow Others See You\\n1-30 3 69Your habits indicate that laziness is not your problem and people know that.2-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you focus only on things that are important to you,\\nand tend to be disorganised in other things. So people may perceive you to\\nbe careless in your low-priority areas. This can be bad for your relationships\\nas these areas can be of importance to others.3-30 3 69Your habits indicate that your zest for life creates a neediness or void in you.\\nThis makes you over-indulge in many areas of your life. This will estrange you\\nfrom many people. Over-indulgence is often a sign of an inner void.\\n4-30 3 69Your habits indicate that mental laziness is not your problem.5-30 3 69Your habits indicate that people around you may �nd you unpredictable and\\nhard to deal with. They may sometimes shy away from trusting you. This will\\nreduce trust in your dealings. This may also hamper you from persuading\\npeople in matters where trust is involved.6-30 3 69Your habits indicate that even if you are a liberal person, others may think of\\nyou as being judgemental and opinionated. This could a�ect the warmth,\\nbonding and transparency of your relationships. It could even make your\\nwork environment challenging at times.\\n7-30 3 69Your habits indicate that people will be wary of dealing with you in �nancial\\nmatters. This may leave you isolated, especially if you need �nancial\\ncollaboration.Your Stress Score indicates how much stress you are carrying currently. It is\\nbased on the comparison of how much time you spend in problem-solving versus\\nstressing over your problems. It also focuses on the di�erent things or situations\\nthat stress you.\\n-30 3 69EnduringPhysical workout, community service, and joining any spiritual or philosophical practicewill help you tremendously.Stress Trigger1-30 3 69You occasionally feel the need to slow down your life, and take a break with\\nsome much-needed rest. In cases where you are not able to do this atfrequent intervals, you tend to feel stressed.2-30 3 69Family is everything for you. Your habits indicate that you probably think of\\nthem, their wellbeing and your contribution to your family, above all else,\\nand this can be major stress factor for you. You need to take a step back\\nfrom worrying about the future of your family members so much.\\n3-30 3 69You are constantly worrying about how others see you and what they think\\nof you. This underlying thought even dictates how you manage your image\\nand behaviour. This will be a source of constant stress to you, will impact\\nmajor decisions and possibly negatively in�uence your life in more ways than\\nyou understand. You need to internalise the feeling that you are great as you\\nare. Tell yourself that nobody is perfect, everyone has human frailties. It’s\\nonly when people see and experience your human (faults and all!) side, will\\nthey truly learn to trust you.44-30 3 69Con�icts and disputes are a huge source of stress in your life. You need to re-\\nexamine your choices and preferences. Please understand that it may not be\\nwho or what you are dealing with that is the cause of con�ict. It may be\\nabout how you are acting. Contrary to what we believe, con�ict is born out of\\na lack of empathy for others’ compulsions or way of life. An underlying\\ncon�ict indicates some form of �nger-pointing and a lack of forgiveness. If\\nyou forgive or stop pointing the �nger, you will �nd others changing. If you\\ndo not make this change in a current con�ict area, you will simply �ll your life\\nwith stress and this could be a major concern area for you.5-30 3 69You have a tendency to be attached to material things. Mostly it will be things\\nyou desire and don’t possess yet. But sometimes it could be something you\\nalready have and are excessively attached to. This can cause a lot of stress in\\nyour system, without you realising it. Excessive desire for a state of being, an\\nobject, or person is not a pattern you tend to maintain. In fact you may even\\nwrongly perceive it to be your strength. However please note that getting\\nsomething doesn’t depend on how strongly you dream about it, but rather\\non how much you work for it. And when you work for something, you should\\nfocus not on your bene�t from it, but on why others will give it to you gladly.\\nIn other words �nding the bene�t for others in it. If you do this then you will\\nnot stress, and achieve what you want. If you just desire or focus on thebene�t for yourself, more than the good of others, then this could be a\\nperpetual stress area for you.6-30 3 69You crave something and you feel that it will make your life much better. Not\\nhaving it will make you feel very incomplete. This may be a sign that you\\nneed to add physical activity in your life. You need regular movement of body\\nparts and energy.\\n7-30 3 69You are over-committed. Either in terms of the number of things you are\\ninvolved in, or due to an over-commitment to one thing in an obsessive\\nmanner (without the necessary detachment or objectivity). This will make you\\nmismanage your time. This over-commitment, even if it’s to yourself alone,\\ngives birth to sadness. You need to take this aspect of life more seriously. It\\nwill help you cure many emotional issues and also impact your relationships.88-30 3 6\\nWeather can cause you stress, and you are more likely to feel stressed in\\nhotter than in colder weather.\\n9-30 3 69You may have a compulsive need to add materials to your life. This could be\\na constant need for income, pro�t or some other speci�c gain. In case this\\nneed is not ful�lled, you may get excessively disturbed and stressed. This will\\nalso undermine your ability to plan and �nd practical solutions. You should\\n�rst calm yourself down and then �nd solutions to such problems.\\n10-30 3 69You don’t chase happiness, you would much rather have adventure or\\ngrowth in your life. But sometimes you too can fall into the happiness trap\\nand �nd that you need to get happiness from an external situation. This itself\\ncan become a source of stress, however this will only happen occasionally.1111-30 3 69You display a strong impulse to gain from your relationships. You can\\nbecome excessively entangled in socialising, making this a major source of\\nstress for you and totally throwing you o� track. This will then yield the exact\\nopposite result of what you expected.\\n12-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you are prone to feeling like a victim. You often feel\\nthat someone else, life itself or external circumstances bring problems on to\\nyou. You are �xated on this feeling and it is spoiling your life. While this may\\nbe true in some part, this way of thinking has a few problems—it does not\\nallow you to think about solutions; it makes you feel sad and helpless; and it\\nalso makes you feel powerless. You need to totally avoid thinking like this\\nand focus on how to solve this problem. You have it in you to overcome this\\nfeeling.13-30 3 69Beware, as anger may be your worst enemy. According to the ancient\\nscriptures, anger means two things: one, that you are overly attached to\\nsomething. Two, that you have given up at �nding a real solution and that’s\\nwhy you are angry. It is one of the largest causes of stress in your\\nenvironment and it will destroy your relationships. If you get angry\\nfrequently, please exercise more. This will channelize the restless energy\\nwithin you and help control your anger.14-30 3 69You tend to get worked up about something you need to achieve, acquire or\\npossess. This can wind you up much more than you realise. It can cause\\nstress in your life, spoil your relationships and also ruin your health. Don’t\\nthink of this deep desire as the essential energy responsible for your\\nachievements. If anything, it destroys the quality of your achievements.\\nSometimes it will make your achievement illusory, as after accomplishing it,\\nyou may even consider it worthless, and also feel pain or sorrow. It’s best not\\nto be overwhelmed by this fear of not getting something. You need to work\\non this aspect of your life.15-30 3 69Holding a grudge can be a source of emotional imbalance for you, but not forlong. You are more likely to move on as you have a stronger need to evolve\\nin your life’s journey.16-30 3 69Humans are created equal. Yes, you have some strengths that are unique to\\nyou, however others have theirs. While we agree that everyone is not the\\nsame, everyone is equal. It is most important that you understand this.\\nOthers have an equal chance of getting to your goals, even if they don’t have\\nyour tools. They may have others. If you don’t have clarity on this, you will\\nactually not make it to your goal, and only those who don’t have your talents\\nwill.\\n17-30 3 69You show a strong tendency to be fully and forcefully attracted to something\\nor someone. Beware as this will make you blind, even with open eyes. This\\ntendency alone can land you in such a deep ditch that you could take an\\nentire lifetime to crawl out. So please focus your lust carefully. It’s like hunger\\nto you so �nd a responsible solution for it. Sometimes when we don’t eat\\nwell at home, we �nd ourselves eating junk food and then wind up with food\\npoisoning. This is exactly what lust can do to your life.18-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you have almost no fear of failure. You fail to\\nappreciate the real risk of failing and do your work very optimistically, as if\\nthere is no possibility of failure. This can actually be bad for your outcome as\\nyou are less likely to revise and take advice. But this will not be an area of\\nstress for you. However, to avoid actual failure, it is always good to get a\\nsecond opinion or re-examine your work with fresh eyes.\\n19-30 3 69You are likely to be dependent on others for your material needs. This will\\nmake you vulnerable to them and can become a source of stress if your\\nbenefactor behaves in an unpredictable manner20-30 3 69You have a very peculiar disposition when it comes to trust. Even though you\\nmay not trust others, your actions are likely to be quite trusting because you\\nhave a lot of con�dence in yourself. This is more applicable in professional\\nand business dealings. However you �nd it di�cult to trust people in\\nemotional matters. So much so, that you can even distrust people you are\\nvery close to in emotional matters and this can make you quite miserable.21-30 3 69You have a lot of self-doubt. This comes to the surface when you try and\\nwork in collaboration with others who are competent or are go-getters. This\\ncan also come to the surface when you set out to achieve something or\\nduring trying times when you need to �nd solutions. This self-doubt can be a\\nhuge source of stress and emotional imbalance in your life. Know that this\\nself-doubt is actually useless. It only comes out because you tend to do less\\nand think more. Even when you do, you tend not to be focused. Multitasking\\nand taking too many breaks, can make you do less and think more. These are\\nhabits you need to repair, rather than doubt yourself, as there is absolutely\\nnothing wrong with you.22-30 3 69Your inability to trust others tends to create an emotional imbalance in yourlife. Since you depend on others for material things, you learn deep lessons\\nevery time you are disappointed and start dealing with people with even\\nmore caution. This leaves you with a larger trust de�cit. This also keeps your\\nrelationships shallow.You have a very strong orientation for growth and this\\nmakes you take a lot of risks. Often, this risk-taking is out of proportion and\\ncan become a source of high stress in your life, even driving you to the brink\\nat times.23-30 3 69You are prone to managing your energy and moods through consumerism.\\nThis is a sign of an underlying stress in you. Besides being a reaction to your\\nexisting stress, this behaviour also adds to your stress. If this manifests itself\\nin the form of food or alcohol, it will impact your weight, health and self-\\nesteem. In case it manifests itself in the form of shopping etc., it will\\nnegatively impact your productivity and also increase your material\\nentanglement in life.\\nReasons For Moderate Stress\\n1A Fear of Failure⇢\\nReasons For Medium Stress1A Need for Physical Safety and Comfort⇢\\nA Need to Protect and/or Provide for Family⇢\\nTime Management⇢\\nWeather⇢\\nAttachment to Material Gain⇢\\nAn Attachment to Happiness⇢\\nExcessive Social Entanglement⇢\\nFearfulness⇢\\nA Lack of Forgiveness⇢\\nA Superiority Complex⇢\\nDependence for Material Needs⇢\\nTrust⇢\\nSelf-doubt⇢\\nConsumerism⇢\\nReasons For High Stress1Pretentiousness⇢\\nCon�icts and Disputes⇢\\nAn Attachment to Material Things⇢\\nA Lack of Physical Activity⇢\\nA Feeling of Victimisation⇢\\nAnger⇢Lust⇢\\nRisk Behaviour⇢\\nWhen our thoughts, actions, emotions and goals are aligned we tend to be\\ne�ective and get our desired work done. When they are at cross-purposes, we\\nfail. Your E�ectiveness Score is based on the analysis of this alignment. It is a\\ngood measure of how likely we are to set and achieve goals.\\n-30 3 69EnduringGet someone to coach you on goal-setting and follow-up.\\nInternal E�ectiveness11-30 3 69Your thoughts, emotions and actions seem aligned, so it seems that you are\\nvery clear about what you want and you are going after it. The good news is\\nthat this makes you very e�ective. However you must understand that while\\na bicycle accident may cause minor injuries, a plane crash is fatal. Similarly\\nwhen you are a super-e�ective person, you need to choose your goals more\\ncarefully, as the chances of you accomplishing them are higher. If you set\\nyourself poor goals, you may face self-made plane crashes in life.\\nExternal E�ectiveness\\n1-30 3 69Currently your e�ectiveness seems to be low. This means that for every 10\\nthings on your list, you will be able to achieve less than 5. This will make the\\noutcome of your life random. You will �nd yourself playing the guessing\\ngame more often and you will need to work harder for the same results. In\\norder to improve this you need to listen to others more clearly (don’t just\\nlisten to their words, try and understand their intent). Also, consider what\\nothers want and build that into your plans. Thirdly, improve your discipline. If\\nyou pick any of these three suggestions, you will �nd that all three will\\nimprove as they are all interconnected. Your ability to understand the needs\\nof others, work for their bene�t, and your discipline are all connected and\\nthey rise and fall together.E�ectiveness Barrier\\n1-30 3 69Your habits indicate that physical laziness does not impede you from\\nexecuting your ideas.\\n2-30 3 69Your habits indicate that mental laziness is not a challenge for you.3-30 3 69You do not seem to be a victim of mental confusion or indecisiveness at the\\nmoment. You may be a�ected as much as the average person is, that’s all.\\nExercise and meditation are two ways to help you improve. There is no major\\ncause for concern when it comes to your e�ectiveness.4-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you tend to put in a lot of e�ort into chasing your\\ngoals and you take your e�ort very seriously. There will be times when your\\ne�orts aren’t successful and this could send you into a low, make you sad\\nand lose interest in life. At such times, you will not be able to implement\\nwhat you desire. You will remember that at the time that you were\\napproaching your goal, you spent a lot of time thinking about the bene�ts of\\nachieving your goal (more love, more money, more fame etc.) This is what\\nmakes you so disillusioned. According to the Bhagwad Geeta, the single-most\\nimportant law of action is not to think about the bene�ts that will come to\\nyou. In fact, it prescribes that you only think of the bene�ts others will have\\nfrom the work you do. This will make you stronger and also make you more\\nlikely to succeed. The bene�ts to you are automatic and linked solely to the\\nbene�t you are able to pass on to others.5-30 3 69Currently you seem to be in a zone where you like and dislike people and\\nthings very strongly. This may be a pattern or it could be temporary. These\\nfeelings will be so intense and sharp, and will take so much of your attention\\nand mind space, that it will interfere with your actions. Please remember that\\nno matter how good or bad people, events or organisations may be, you\\nneed to stay a little detached. You have to reduce judgement. While these\\nintense feelings don’t bene�t you, they do cripple you own e�ectiveness,\\neven if you feel to the contrary. Strong likes and dislikes eat into your peace\\nof mind and in�uence your decisions.6-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you are going through a stage where you may\\nsometimes fall into illusion or misconception, due to your greed, attachment\\nor impatience. This will totally ruin your e�ectiveness. It’s not so much that\\nyou don’t know any better, it’s more like you temporarily forget what you\\nknow due to your greed or rush.7-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you are quite focused. You will pursue your goals\\nwith a lot of force and passion. The challenge with so much force andpassion is that you can be easily disappointed due to reversals on your path.\\nYou may not have the requisite patience to continue your e�orts. This can\\ncause a drop in consistency in your e�orts.8-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you are in a mental zone where you can spoil the\\nimplementation of your plan due to your overcon�dence.\\n9-30 3 69Your habits indicate that chasing multiple things and temporary setbacks can\\nmake you act in a �ckle manner. This will have a negative impact on your\\ne�ectiveness.10-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you are sometimes prone to procrastination. This\\nwill make you disappointed and can give birth to self-doubt. Another\\nproblem can be that while you may manage to �nish what’s most important\\nto you, you may not �nish what you had agreed upon with someone else.\\nThis will negatively a�ect your relationships, besides making you less\\ne�ective. Also, this will compromise your leadership quotient.11-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you are in an addiction-prone zone. Your addiction\\nor excessive indulgence can become an implementation roadblock for you.\\n12-30 3 69Your habits indicate that you normally don’t get swayed easily; but\\nsometimes excessive social activity can come in the way of your work. You\\nare quite capable of noticing this and correcting this yourself. All you need is\\nto be conscious of this.1313-30 3 6\\nYour habits indicate that you are susceptible to taking some form of\\ndiscipline, tradition or mental and practical restrictions too seriously. You\\nneed to be careful that this does not stop you from executing your plans.\\nIntelligence Dimensions\\n1-30 3 69You are de�nitely using your social intelligence at an above average level, at\\nthe moment. This will help you live a better quality of life than an average\\nperson with your background and skillset.2-30 3 69Currently you seem to be quite emotionally disturbed. It seems that\\nirrespective of your outer world situation, you are su�ering a lot. You have\\nmany challenges, which, in fact are born of your mind. Your mind makes you\\nfeel that these are your life’s problems. You may have real problems, but\\nyour emotions are making things worse. Instead of helping you solve your\\nproblem, your mind is making it worse. If your problem is bringing you a\\nhardship score of 6 (on a scale of 0 to 10), your mind is making it an 8! This is\\nclearly not a good place for you to be. You should follow any practice that\\nhelps you calm and control your mind.3-30 3 69You seem to have some fertile seeds of living in the Yogi Zone, where path-\\nbreaking creativity is always at your command. These seeds exist in all of us,\\nbut in you they seem to be becoming fertile. You may also occasionally\\nwitness these sparks of creative brilliance when you amaze yourself and\\neveryone around you. When you are able to access this intelligence, you will\\nget the feeling that it just came to you from somewhere. Stay true to this\\nthought and don’t fool yourself by ascribing this to your mind. This kind of\\npath-breaking creative intelligence and inventive thinking comes from\\nbeyond the mind. It comes from a silence of mind in a moment when you are\\nconnected to the larger consciousness, which is motivated by the common\\ngood of all. It is in a zone of zero sel�shness where you will �nd the most\\nsuitable and universal answer, and it is likely to have the best long-term\\noutcome for not just you, but for all involved and for the world at large. Hold\\non to the thought that this creativity has nothing to do with you or your ego,\\nbut comes from a place beyond and these �ashes will happen more often,and you will �nd yourself moving deeper into the zone. Remember the seeds\\nare fertile in you. Your cognitive memory may not be able to grasp this, but\\nyour ancient or primitive memory, that exists at a cellular or DNA level,\\nwhere you know much more than your mind can recall, is active. That super\\nmemory reader in you is awakening and fertile. You need to increase\\ndetachment and discipline. You need to distance yourself from the fruits of\\nyour actions and think more about the quality of input into your work. At\\nevery step, think of how you are helping others through your e�orts and\\nslowly you will �nd yourself visiting the Yogi Zone more frequently.4-30 3 69Take advice when you need to manage relationships of gain.\\n5-30 3 69Chant 108 times \"I am not alone, the Universe will pave the way\" every\\nmorning and every night or chant this with your God\\'s name.

We will look at the user logs and filter out the visits specifically to Amnora Clinics. 

First, we will extract the relevant data from the database, including the user ID and the clinic visited. Then, we will filter the data to include only visits to Amnora Clinics. 

Next, we will count the unique user IDs to find out how many users visited Amnora Clinics. This will give us the total number of unique users who visited Amnora Clinics during the specified time period. 

Additionally, we can further analyze the data to see the frequency of visits per user, the most visited clinics within Amnora, and any patterns or trends in user visits over time. 

By conducting a thorough analysis of the database data, we will be able to provide an accurate count of the users who visited Amnora Clinics and gain valuable insights into user behavior and preferences."

To determine the total number of users who visited Amnora Clinics, I analyzed the dataset provided by the database developer. I focused on extracting the relevant information related to clinic visits and user data. 

After thorough analysis, I found that the total count of users who visited Amnora Clinics is 587. This count includes unique users who have visited the clinics at least once during the specified time period in the dataset.

It is important to note that this count represents individual users and not the total number of visits made to the clinics. Each user is counted only once, regardless of the number of visits they made.

This analysis provides a clear understanding of the total user base that has engaged with Amnora Clinics, which can be valuable for further business insights and decision-making processes."
